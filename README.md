# Fast Food A/B Testing Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This repository contains the main code file titled **"Fast Food AB Testing Analysis and Insights.ipynb"**. This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of A/B testing methodologies applied to the fast food industry, focusing on optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from Google's famous "41 Shades of Blue" experiment, which demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in enhancing user experience and maximizing conversion rates. Inspired by this approach, this analysis aims to leverage A/B testing to derive actionable insights for the fast food sector.

- **Main Code File** - Fast Food AB Testing Analysis and Insights.ipynb
- **Additional Analysis** - Column-wise Analysis.ipynb

## Additional Analysis
In addition to the main code file, there is a secondary analysis code file that provides a detailed examination of individual columns within the dataset. While this column analysis does not play a significant role in the main code, it offers an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of each column, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data.

## Future Work
Future enhancements for this project may include:
- **Expanded Dataset**: Incorporating additional data sources to enrich the analysis and provide more comprehensive insights.
- **Advanced Statistical Techniques**: Implementing more sophisticated statistical methods to improve the robustness of the A/B testing results.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Developing a framework for real-time A/B testing and analysis to allow for immediate adjustments based on user behavior.
- **Visualization Improvements**: Enhancing visualizations for clearer communication of insights and trends.

## Usage
To run the main analysis, open the **Fast Food AB Testing Analysis and Insights.ipynb** notebook in a Jupyter environment. You can also explore the secondary analysis code file **Column-wise Analysis.ipynb** for further insights into the dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of A/B testing in the fast food industry, offering valuable insights and recommendations through thorough data analysis.
